SOUND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY CUSTOM WORDPRESS THEME
------------------------------------------------

This wordpress theme is currently in production at https://www.sounddev.co/. The theme showcases multiple ways in which to hook into and modify content for a Wordpress theme. It uses a template from https://underscores.me/ as the basic scaffold.

There are multiple custom templates within this theme. home_page.php allows front end manipulation of the content via Wordpress widgets. 

There are various other templates for special pages such as contact.php and careers.php. post-loop.php has the templating logic that displays all the latest blog posts, but it can easily be customized to display the information for any custom post type. 

in /js/home.js, you will see the main logic for the home page. This includes some basic use of the web audio api as well as all the logic for the automatic scrolling and home page sliders. In this case, I opted to make a slider from scratch with JS rather than use a plug-in.
